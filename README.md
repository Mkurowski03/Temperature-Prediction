# Temperature Prediction
 Different models of ML used for predicting temeprature based on other weather parametrs.
 
 [Data plus regression tree](https://github.com/Mkurowski03/Temperature-Prediction/blob/main/DataPlusRegressionTree.ipynb) - File where I explore data, make some visualisations, change some variables and format them. Then I create first model that is a regression tree.

[Regression Tree Project](https://github.com/Mkurowski03/Temperature-Prediction/blob/main/RegressionTreeProject.ipynb) - Another try of creating a Regression Tree with diffrent data format and better score.

[PolynomialRegression](https://github.com/Mkurowski03/Temperature-Prediction/blob/main/PolynomialRegression.ipynb) - Polynomial regression model

[Linear Regression](https://github.com/Mkurowski03/Temperature-Prediction/blob/main/LinearRegression.ipynb) - Linear Regression model
